First big project. It was intended to be game store imitation. Looks and feel inspired by EGS but works worse then EGS :smile:

Had plans to refactor and turn into my pet project but decided not to. Still is one of the biggest projects that I made by myself.
Backend is broken because mongodb and heroku delited all data in it.
