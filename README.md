First big project. It was intended to be game store imitation. Looks and feel inspired by EGS but works worse than EGS :smile:

Had plans to refactor and turn into my pet project, but decided not to. Still is one of the biggest projects that I made by myself.
Backend is broken because MongoDB and Heroku deleted all data in it. Because backend is broken, you can't get past the loading screen in deployment. Host yourself somehow if you want to, lol.

1. [Backend](https://github.com/Leniorko/college-japanece-point-backend)
2. [Resources used back then](https://github.com/Leniorko/college-japanece-point-resources)

I can't remember proper structures for backend, but you can figure it out. I believe in you
